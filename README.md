# Algo_DS

This repo contains implementation of some data structure and their related algorithms. Most of the algorithms come from the book (Introduction to algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, Clifford Stein). Feel free to contribute, comment or add your own implementation of those algorithms.

We implement these algorithms with JS or Python and for each we will try to give the time complexity.

## List of Data Structure concerned (this list will be updated as we add more algorithms)
- Array
- Trees
- Graph
